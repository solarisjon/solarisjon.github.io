# Vino Overview

Latest AFF A-Series product offering, also known as Vino.  Although the official RTS date of June 25th is a month from now, our collective achievements to date remind me of a significant event that took place nearly 55 years ago, on a parallel timeline.
Our teams have spent significant effort and had an amazing partnership with Enterprise storage team in bringing this Launch. Performance, Efficiency, Autonomous Ransomware Protection built into ONTAP, Intelligent and seamless Data Management, Simplicity, Scale, Efficiency – every major talking point of these platforms have your fingerprints. The modular approach used on Vino brings resiliency and high reuse of hardware and software support across the range of Vino platforms and into the Gizo platform family that will ship later in FY25. ONTAP 9.15.1, with many of the big rocks getting to launch/Tech Preview, will add significant tailwind to this launch. Our Quality metrics have been on the mend since 9.12.1 and the team tells me 9.14.1 is doing well on all Quality benchmarks compared to the last two releases.
