## Documentation

 A B+ tree is a type of self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It's an extension of the B-tree and is commonly used in databases and file systems.

Here are some key characteristics of a B+ tree:

1. **Balanced Tree**: A B+ tree is a balanced tree, meaning that all leaf nodes are at the same level. This ensures that the tree remains balanced and operations can be performed in O(log n) time.

2. **Leaf Nodes**: Unlike a B-tree, where keys and data can be stored in all nodes, in a B+ tree, all data is stored in the leaf nodes. The internal nodes only store keys to guide the search.

3. **Sequential Access**: Leaf nodes are linked together in a linked list, which allows for efficient sequential access to the data. This is particularly useful for range queries.

4. **Order**: A B+ tree of order m (where m is the maximum number of children a node can have) ensures that each node (except the root) has at least ⌈m/2⌉ children and at most m children.

### Advantages of B+ Tree

- **Efficient Search**: Due to its balanced nature, searches can be performed in logarithmic time.
- **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Insertions and deletions are also efficient and maintain the balanced property of the tree.
- **Range Queries**: The linked list of leaf nodes allows for efficient range queries and sequential access.

### Example

Here’s a simple example to illustrate the structure of a B+ tree:

Assume we have a B+ tree of order 4. This means each node can have a maximum of 4 children and 3 keys.

```
           [20 | 40]
          /    |    \
     [10, 15] [25, 30, 35] [45, 50, 55]
```

In this example:
- The root node has two keys (20 and 40) and three children.
- The leaf nodes contain the actual data and are linked together for sequential access.

### Operations

- **Search**: Start from the root and move down to the leaf nodes by comparing keys.
- **Insertion**: Insert the key in the appropriate leaf node. If the node overflows, split the node and propagate the split upwards.
- **Deletion**: Remove the key from the leaf node. If the node underflows, redistribute or merge nodes and propagate the changes upwards if necessary.
