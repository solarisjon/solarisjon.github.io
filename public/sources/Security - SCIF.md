A **sensitive compartmented information facility** (**SCIF** [/skɪf/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")), in [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") military, national security/national defense and intelligence parlance, is an enclosed area within a building that is used to process [sensitive compartmented information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information "Sensitive compartmented information") (SCI) types of [classified information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information "Classified information").

SCIFs can be either permanent or temporary and can be set up in official government buildings (such as the [Situation Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room "Situation Room") in the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House "White House")), onboard ships, in private residences of officials, or in hotel rooms and other places of necessity for officials when traveling.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-SCIF-1) Portable SCIFs can also be quickly set up when needed during emergency situations.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-TT-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-3)

Because of the [operational security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_security "Operational security") (OPSEC) risk they pose, personal cell phones, smart watches, computer [flash drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_drive "Flash drive") (aka, "thumb drives"), or any other sort of personal electronic device (PED), cameras (analog or digital) other than those that are U.S. Government property and which are used only under strict guidelines, and/or any other sort of recording or transmitting devices (analog or digital) are expressly prohibited in SCIFs.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-5)

## Access

Access to SCIFs is normally limited to those individuals with appropriate [security clearances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance "Security clearance").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-6) Non-cleared personnel in SCIFs must be under the constant oversight of cleared personnel and all classified information and material removed from view to prevent unauthorized access.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-7) As part of this process, non-cleared personnel are also typically required to surrender all recording, photographic and other electronic media devices. All of the activity and conversation inside is presumed restricted from public disclosure.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-SCIF-1)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_compartmented_information_facility#cite_note-Lago-8)
